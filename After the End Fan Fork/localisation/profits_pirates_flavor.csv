EVTNAMECONSUMER21;The Victorious Prophet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCONSUMER21;The Consumerist prophet Adam has successfully led his followers against their enemies, guaranteeing a foothold for his new religion with an army at his back. While many realms react with mockery or horror at this victory, the Prophet has declared that he shall spread his faith as far as the Almighty Dollar will allow, so that he may save the world from another collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACONSUMER21;America shall prosper as it once did!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_disneyconsumer1;The Mouse and The Prophet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_disneyconsumer1;A Consumerist diplomat has arrived at my court for an audience. He explains that the National Mall has taken interest in the affairs of The Mouse, as our predecessors once corporatized America's greatest artists and stories. If I accept a conversion to Consumerism, the Prophet will send an investment to back any of our future conquests in Florida and restore our former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_disneyconsumer1;The House of Mouse accepts your deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_black_friday_1;Black Friday;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_black_friday_1;I joined a mass of faithful Consumerists at the tent encampment that had been set up outside the Market doors, setting up my own tent alongside them. It has been customary since pre-Event times for adherents of the Almighty Dollar to camp together outside on the night before Black Friday, so that they can share camradery before the following day-long spree of competitive Shopping. Night eventually turned to morning, and I made my way towards the market doors, heading inside to begin my Shopping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_black_friday_1;May the Almighty Dollar bless me with a quick cart and excellent savings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_black_friday_2;I wander through the halls and aisles in a rush, reminding myself that I must not slow down lest others win the Dollar's favor first. What was it that I needed to buy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_black_friday_2;A useful gadget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_black_friday_2;A fashionable attire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_black_friday_3;I head towards the toy aisles on the other end of the store, browsing their collection of playthings while other parents do the same. What sort of toy should I get my children this Black Friday?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_black_friday_3;Any old toy will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_black_friday_3;I want to get them a decent toy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_black_friday_4;Gadgets are where I head to, scanning the various doohickies and Old World antiques on the shelves. Most of them either don't work anymore or are cheap replacements, but owning one anyway wouldn't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_black_friday_4;A fully functioning or truly invaluable gadget, of the highest quality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_black_friday_5;I make my way towards the Clothing section, seeking attire that I can show off or at least comfortably wear. New apparel is the most common and obvious method for a Consumerist to express their Shopping expertise, and now I should decide what sort of clothes I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_black_friday_5;Basic robes are fine for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
