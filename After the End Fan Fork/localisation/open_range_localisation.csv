EVTTITLE_orfelection_1;Choosing an Opponent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelection_1;As a direct vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and a proud [Root.GetTitle] of the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], I have a right to run for a Senate seat — whether there is a Senator vulnerable enough to lose to me is another matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_1;[orf_opponent_1.GetTitledFirstName] is an appointee and thus fair game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelection_1;I've long thought that my party opponent [orf_opponent_2.GetTitledFirstName] should lose [orf_opponent_2.GetHerHis] seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelection_1;[orf_opponent_3.GetTitledFirstName] of my party is admittedly a weak legislator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_orfelection_1;Maybe I should wait a bit before I run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liege_may_intervene_TT;If your liege is able to dismiss senators at will, then [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] can intervene to prevent an election from occuring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_6;[orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to run against [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetTitledFirstName] for [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetHerHis] Senate seat. Since I have the power of appointment and dismissal of senators, I could intervene to stop this election before it begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_6;What's the harm in a bit of competition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_6_TT;You refrain from intervening and allow an election for [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetTitledFirstName]'s seat to be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelection_6;Under no circumstances must this election continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelection_6_TT;You inform [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetTitledFirstName] and [orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetTitledFirstName] that there will be no election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_orfelection_7;The [Root.Liege.GetRulerTitle] Intervenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelection_7;In accordance with the laws of [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] has invoked [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] right to decide who sits on [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] Senate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_7_defender;I am relieved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_7_attacker;Damn the law, this is a breach of my rights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_3;[orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to run against me for my Senate seat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_3;I'll fight this to the bitter end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_3_TT;Accept [orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetTitledFirstName]'s challenge and run against [orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetHerHim] in an election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_orfelection_3_TT;Resign your Senate seat instead of contesting the election. You will not be able to run for the Senate for two years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_4;It is customary for senatorial candidates to criss-cross the realm campaigning and rubbing elbows with the electors. While it would be great to be able to visit every corner of the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetTier], it is best to focus on getting the most out of my effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_5;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to not run against you, and with [From.GetHerHis] departure you may assume [From.GetHerHis] seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_5; That wasn't so hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_orfelection_51;Election Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelection_51;I now stand as Senator-elect, having overcome [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetTitledFirstName] in a tight election. Now all the responsibilities of being a Senator rest upon my shoulders, and I now only hope that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] keeps me away from any misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_51;I stand ready to represent my constituents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_orfelection_52;Election Loss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_orfelection_54;I stand ready to represent my constituents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_55;Due to [orf_election_opponent_attacker.GetTitledFirstName]'s electoral challenge against [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetTitledFirstName] for [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetHerHis] Senate seat, the now ex-Senator has resigned their post in favor of [orf_election_opponent_defender.GetHerHis] challenger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While, [FromFrom.GetHerHis] family and friends must gather and mourn their death, it has left an opportunity for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to assume victory as the default winner of the election for the later Senator's seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelection_106;What a sad outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelection_107;Grim news has arrived at my ranch. My vassal [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has unfortunately died.

EVTOPB_orfelection_23_TT;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will be disappointed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;A clamor has arisen in the great hall as throngs of nobles and their families jostle to find their seats and servants file in with trays of meat, the smell of barbecue not far behind. After pacing back and forth in the antechamber preparing your speech for what seems like an eternity, you steel yourself and enter the room filled with lords and ladies enjoying the largesse of you and your cattle. Merriment transforms into hushed silence once your entrance is announced. Now's the time to make an impression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Move the crowd with an emotional personal story;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Flatter yourself before the crowd;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Try to say whatever they want to hear, however they want to hear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_minor_meeting;Every eye in the room is on you once you take your seat at the head of the table. After a series of customary, perfunctory greetings and acknowledgements, you leap into your speech. Leaping from topic to topic, the crowd remains silent as they hang on to every word that falls from your mouth. Finally, as you finish your speech with an ancient and famous quote, there is a silence, and then an applause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_minor_meeting;Every eye in the room is on you once you take your seat at the head of the table. After a series of customary, perfunctory greetings and acknowledgements, you begin reciting your prepared speech. However, your tongue seems to have twisted itself into knots as you stumble over anecdotes and fail to maintain your once captive audience. Your face becomes almost scarlet with embarrassment as you scan the table and realize that most of the barbecue's attendees have either stopped paying attention or never started, more interested in their drinks, meals, or prior conversations than whatever it is you rambled about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_minor_meeting;Sitting at the head of the table, you have now taken the place of the barbecue as the center of the attention. This is certainly not to your benefit, as you almost immediately are overcome by the pressure. The crowd is unable to hide its secondhand embarrassment while you stutter through your speech. You switch between topics without subtlety — let alone grace — and you begin to question why you even began this campaign. Murmurs and muffled laughter can be heard as your speech mercifully comes to an end, the result being that the mood resembles more a funeral than a party.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_minor_meeting;My cause has sway!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_minor_meeting;Could have been worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_minor_meeting;By [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] the embarrassment might just kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_merchants;As you begin your day, you hear word that a small group of traveling merchants from exotic lands have arrived in your territory looking for new locations to ply their goods. They seem to have already set up a stall in the market square and a crowd has formed, jostling both to purchase their wares and catch a glimpse of the foreigners. Your campaign could benefit from speaking with them personally. Not only would a good deal with these wanderers bring some small amount of prosperity, but if you play your cards right they may even spread word of you and impress some voters. Of course, it is possible you may offend them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_merchants;I must pay them a visit and see if I can arrange some sort of deal with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_merchants; I shall dress finely to impress them and welcome them to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_merchants;Best to not interfere with their dealings, I'll leave them to sell their goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants are quite impressed with your realm. They've sold out their stock and the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] proudly show off the various trinkets they've purchased as local artisans look on in envy. The leader of the merchant caravan even stops by your court seeking an audience. He compliments the market savvy of your people and promises that he'll make sure to return and to recommend your lands to any of his friends he comes across. Not only will your people benefit from such an arrangement, but you also look quite good in the eyes of the voters for attracting new business. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;The merchants who have recently  come to your lands seem to have made a decent enough profit, though by all reports they were eager to continue their travels. You suppose there wasn't much else you could have hoped for: they've been through dozens of places just like yours and have moved on from each one, why would [Root.Capital.GetName] be any different? While you didn't manage to impress the merchants in the process, you at least managed to come off as somewhat business-minded. Perhaps that will be enough to sway some voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants who've come into town find [Root.Capital.GetName] rather disagreeable. After several incidents including a particularly nasty bar fight, the whole caravan has packed up their goods and left town, cursing your name and threatening to warn others to avoid these barbaric lands. You can already imagine your rivals laughing both at your inability to provide proper hospitality and the wild tales being told of your people's misconduct. This will certainly reflect rather poorly on you as a ruler, and as an extension, your electability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;A vote for me is a vote for prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;Business as usual on the campaign trail then...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;They just could not behave, could they?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_rangers;Some rangers have recently come into town. Such an occurance is typical, but these particular men have made quite a reputation for themselves over the past few days. A stream of reports have arrived at your desk recounting the roguish exploits of these men, ranging from cheating at cards to pig stealing. You cannot say for certain what is true and what is embellished, but it is very clear that the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] expect you to deal with them. Although the rangers are certainly no good for your realm, they also presents an opportunity to strengthen your electoral chances by looking like a strong ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_rangers;I'll have to speak to these rangers, hopefully they can be reasoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_rangers;An example should be made out of them to show everyone who's in charge here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_rangers;They will heed the wise words of the local [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_rangers;It seems your efforts have paid off. Whether from the absence of the troublemakers among their ranks or a change of spirits within the group, the rangers in town now are acting much more civilized and some even make quick apologies to various people they've offended. There still is a case or two of public drunkenness but the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] breathe a sigh of relief that the worst trouble is over from those rowdy rangers. Having so quickly and effectively dealt with them has reflected well on your reputation as a strong and capable leader, something you make sure to make clear to any prospective voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_rangers;Evidently not much can be done with the group of rangers from out of town. You had hoped to dissuade them from further antics but they seem to have brushed you off, continuing their troublemaking until your people had enough. A group of local men, fed up with these outsiders, gathered a posse and ran them out of town. This instance of vigilante justice does solve the problem, but your inability to manage it yourself does not reflect well on your abilities. Your reputation amongst the voters remains more or less unchanged, which possibly is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_rangers;Things have not gone nearly as well as you had hoped. Instead of toning down their escapades, the rangers resolved to escalate their antics into a reign of terror. What followed was a night of bar fights, robberies, a prison break, and unfortunately a few deaths. Eventually your deputies were able to arrest the troublemakers, but the damage was already done. It will take a long time for you to live this down, and the story of the Rowdy Rangers of [Root.Capital.GetName] has already spread to other settlements. Plenty of nobles have heard this tale during their feasts, harming your chances as being elected Senator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_rangers;Vote [Root.GetBestName] for peace and order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_rangers;Keeping the peace is hard work...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_rangers;I can already hear my opponent shouting "[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is weak on crime";;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger;Recently, there has been talk of a once proud ranger family that has since fallen on hard times — their debts have caught up to them and the family patriarch has had to sell most of their property to stay afloat. And after nearly all of their herd died of sickness, they're on the verge of losing everything. It's truly a sorry state of affairs, but perhaps you can do something about it. While most people at court merely shake their heads in pity, you have the resources to help these people and, perhaps more cynically, the potential to look very electable in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_help;I'll show generosity, this family is in desperate need of charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_encourage;I shall offer some public words of encouragement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_organize;Perhaps I can inspire others at court to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#resolution
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_good;Your methods have paid off! The once destitute ranger family has slowly begun to recover. They have managed to pay off most of their debts and were able to set aside enough money to purchase cattle for their dwindling herd. It may take some time for them to fully regain their former status, but it's now a much more achieveable goal. The patriarch has personally thanked you and promised to spread word of your kindness and generosity. During the last few days you cannot help but notice that the story is on the lips of many in court and your household, certainly helping your electoral chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_good;Help [Root.GetTitledFirstName] help yourself! Vote [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_neutral;The ranger family manages to more or less stay afloat thanks to the token help they've received after you took an interest in them. They have managed to at least pay the interest on their debt but little more than that, and they're still unable to set aside enough money to purchase cattle to make up for their lost herd. They may be saved from complete ruin but the next few years will be hard indeed, and with little cattle to call their own they can barely call themselves rangers anymore. You've done what you can, and the family is thankful enough, but there is not much hope for them at present and you doubt any voters will be especially impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_neutral;How will they financially recover from this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_bad;Perhaps you overestimated how much help you could provide the ranger family down on their luck, or perhaps their debt was just too high, and their income too low. In any case your efforts to help this once proud family have come to naught. Just yesterday they were forced to sell the last of their possessions, including the estate which housed their family for generations, just to keep the collectors at bay. It seems some among your peers see your failure to help these people as disqualifying for a candidate, and the voters you tried to impress with your generosity have only been disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_bad_worse;It seems your words of encouragement were useless. Yesterday they were forced to sell the last of their possessions, including the estate which had housed the family for generations, in order to appease the debt collectors. What is more tragic is the effect this has had on your reputation. The many among the nobility now sees your so-called advocacy as the cause of the family's destitution and shudder to think what you would mismanage in the Senate if given the opportunity. It probably would have been best to stay out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_bad;What a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_bad_worse;They should have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps... if they had any.;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters;While normally your marshals patrol the range and keep the peace in your name, you have decided that it would benefit your campaign to devote some time toward administering range justice. It is on one of these patrols that you encounter a small squatters' settlement. Squatting on the range is not uncommon, but you hadn't expected to come across what seems to a ramshackle home built only a few days' ride from [Root.Capital.GetName]. While squatters have certainly been heroicized by commoners, your noble electorate has no tolerance for a violation of range rights. You must do something, so you ponder your options.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_cash_help;These people cannot stay here, but I can make sure they can afford a home elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_convince_unsafe;Perhaps I can convince them it's not safe to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_force_out;Call my men to throw them out and tear down the home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_good;The whole matter surprisingly proves to be less trouble than you expected. The family, perhaps knowing that they would have to leave eventually, do not offer much resistance. They gather their possessions and begin heading off, perhaps to some other lord's lands, but at least they are no longer squatting in yours. When word spreads on how decisively you dealt with the issue, your reputation among the nobles improved greatly. You seem to have impressed many of your peers, who also have dealt with squatters, and gained their respect. You've likely won a few votes from this little incident.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_good;Vote [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to stop squatters!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_neutral;Evicting the squatters requires a bit more effort than expected. The family is attached to their little home and reluctant to leave. It takes almost half a day before they finally give up and begin to pack up their belongings and even longer for them to actually leave. But they do eventually leave. When you return home you hear whispers about the incident and your conduct, but overall the event has shifted the minds of your court very little. You haven't exactly won any new respect as a ruler, but no change is better than a poor one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_neutral;Who would have thought that dealing with vagrants would be so complicated.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_bad;The squatter family took your eviction efforts very poorly. When they were informed of your decision, one of the sons approaches your posse and begs you to let them stay. From there matters quickly escalated. After a short standoff your deputies eventually managed to arrest the squatters, setting the shack on fire once the area was clear. On your return home the tales your deputies tell don't exactly paint you favorably, and word spreads of your callousness and ineffectiveness.

open_range_feudalism_government;Open Range Feudalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
open_range_feudalism_government_desc;Open Range Feudalism operates similarly to normal feudalism, although the economics of the praire has resulted in an entirely different relationship between rulers and their vassals. Nobles make their profits through cattle ranching and exchange services to their lord for exclusive grazing rights. A special building in the provincial capital represents the expanse of the grazable range in a certain province, which is determined by the number of empty holdings. Additionally, the freedom of the range has bred an independence streak into the nobility and has caused an increased demand participation in governance. As a consequence, it is customary for Open Range rulers to maintain a Senate which may either be chosen by the ruler or elected by the nobles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
